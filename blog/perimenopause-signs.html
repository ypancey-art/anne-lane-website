      <p>Every woman has heard about hot flashes. They've become the unofficial mascot of perimenopause — the one symptom that gets talked about, joked about, and occasionally, sympathised over. But in my clinical practice, hot flashes are often not the first thing women notice, and sometimes not even the most disruptive.</p>

      <p>Perimenopause can begin anywhere from your late 30s to your mid-40s — often years before your period actually stops. And in that window, your body is sending signals that are easy to miss, dismiss, or attribute to stress, aging, or simply being a busy woman.</p>

      <p>Here are ten of the less-talked-about signs I see most frequently in practice.</p>

      <h2>1. Anxiety that seems to come out of nowhere</h2>
      <p>If you've never been an anxious person and suddenly find yourself waking at 3am with a racing heart and a vague sense of dread, your hormones may be behind it. Estrogen plays a direct role in serotonin and GABA production — the neurotransmitters that keep us calm. As estrogen fluctuates, so can your emotional baseline.</p>

      <h2>2. Rage — sudden, out-of-proportion, and surprising</h2>
      <p>Many of my clients describe a kind of anger they've never experienced before. Not sadness or anxiety, but a sharp, unexpected fury triggered by ordinary things. This is often progesterone-related. Progesterone is our calming, "all is well" hormone. When it drops before estrogen does, the imbalance can tip us toward irritability and emotional reactivity.</p>

      <h2>3. Brain fog and memory lapses</h2>
      <p>Forgetting words mid-sentence. Walking into a room and having no idea why. Struggling to concentrate in a meeting. Estrogen supports cognitive function and neuroprotection. As levels shift, many women experience real, noticeable changes in memory and mental clarity — and are often told it's just stress.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"Your body is not breaking down. It's going through a significant hormonal shift — and with the right support, it can do so gracefully."</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>4. Changes in your cycle — before it becomes irregular</h2>
      <p>Shorter cycles, heavier periods, or spotting between periods can all precede the classic "irregular periods" that most people associate with perimenopause. If your previously predictable cycle starts changing, pay attention — your hormones are beginning to shift.</p>

      <h2>5. Waking between 2am and 4am</h2>
      <p>This specific window of wakefulness is often linked to cortisol and blood sugar dysregulation, both of which are influenced by declining estrogen and progesterone. Many women describe lying awake with a busy mind, often experiencing anxiety or a mild sense of doom.</p>

      <h2>6. Joint pain and stiffness</h2>
      <p>Estrogen is anti-inflammatory. As levels drop, many women notice new aches and stiffness — particularly in the mornings, or in joints that were never problematic before. This is frequently overlooked as a perimenopausal symptom and attributed to "getting older."</p>

      <h2>7. Heart palpitations</h2>
      <p>A fluttering or racing sensation in the chest can be unsettling and is often investigated by cardiologists who find nothing wrong. In perimenopause, estrogen fluctuations directly affect the autonomic nervous system and cardiac function, causing palpitations that are real but not dangerous.</p>

      <h2>8. Changes in body composition</h2>
      <p>Gaining weight around the middle despite no change in diet or exercise is one of the most common and frustrating experiences of perimenopause. Estrogen influences how and where we store fat. As it shifts, the body preferentially deposits fat viscerally — around the organs. This is a hormonal shift, not a personal failure.</p>

      <h2>9. Low libido or changes in sexual function</h2>
      <p>Declining estrogen and testosterone (yes, women need testosterone too) affect desire, arousal, and vaginal comfort. This is rarely discussed openly but affects a significant number of women in perimenopause. It is addressable — naturally and effectively.</p>

      <h2>10. A general sense that something is "off"</h2>
      <p>This one is perhaps the most important. Many of my clients describe a feeling that's hard to articulate — that they don't feel like themselves. Not depressed exactly, not sick exactly. Just off. When you know your body well and it starts behaving differently, that instinct is worth listening to.</p>

      <h2>What to do if you recognise yourself here</h2>
      <p>First — you're not imagining it, and you're not overreacting. These are real physiological shifts that respond well to targeted naturopathic support.</p>

      <p>In my practice, I use an integrative approach drawing on Traditional Chinese Medicine, Functional Medicine, and nutritional protocols to investigate what's driving your specific pattern of symptoms. Perimenopause is not one-size-fits-all, and neither is the support.</p>

      <p>The goal is not to eliminate the transition — it's to move through it with as much clarity, energy, and ease as possible.</p>
