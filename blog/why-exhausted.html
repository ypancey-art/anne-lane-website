      <p>Fatigue is the symptom I hear about most. Not tiredness — the kind that resolves after a good night's sleep — but a bone-deep exhaustion that is present regardless of how much rest you get. The kind where you wake up already feeling depleted. Where getting through the day feels like an achievement in itself.</p>

      <p>And almost universally, women who come to me with this experience have been told their blood work is "normal." They've been advised to sleep more, stress less, exercise more — perhaps to take an iron supplement or a B vitamin. They've tried these things. They're still exhausted.</p>

      <p>So what's actually going on?</p>

      <h2>Fatigue is a symptom, not a diagnosis</h2>
      <p>This distinction matters enormously. Fatigue tells you something is off in your physiology — it does not tell you what. And yet it's often treated as the endpoint of investigation rather than the beginning.</p>

      <p>In my practice, I look at fatigue as a puzzle with multiple potential contributing factors. Rarely is there just one. More often, there are three or four things interacting — and addressing only one of them produces limited improvement.</p>

      <h2>The most common roots of chronic fatigue in women</h2>

      <h3>1. Iron deficiency — even within "normal" range</h3>
      <p>Standard blood panels often report ferritin (stored iron) as normal when it is technically within range but far too low for optimal function. Many women feel significantly better when ferritin is above 70–80 ng/mL, yet values of 12–20 are often reported as acceptable. If you're exhausted and your ferritin hasn't been checked — or was checked and deemed "fine" — this is worth revisiting.</p>

      <h3>2. Thyroid function — the full picture</h3>
      <p>TSH alone is an incomplete picture of thyroid health. Free T3, Free T4, and thyroid antibodies (TPO and TgAb) together tell a much more useful story. Subclinical hypothyroidism — where TSH is at the high end of normal and symptoms are present — is frequently missed. So is Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition affecting the thyroid that causes fluctuating and often profound fatigue.</p>

      <h3>3. HPA axis dysregulation (often called "adrenal fatigue")</h3>
      <p>The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis governs your cortisol response — your body's primary stress system. Chronic stress, poor sleep, and blood sugar instability can dysregulate this axis over time, resulting in a flattened or abnormal cortisol curve. Symptoms include waking unrefreshed, an energy crash in the afternoon, reliance on caffeine, and feeling "wired but tired" in the evenings.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"Exhaustion is your body asking for attention. In my experience, it almost always has an addressable cause — often several."</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>4. Hormonal shifts — particularly in perimenopause</h3>
      <p>Declining estrogen and progesterone directly affect sleep architecture, mitochondrial function, and the sensitivity of cells to insulin. Many women in perimenopause experience fatigue as one of their first and most persistent symptoms — often before cycle changes make it obvious what's happening. Poor sleep quality (even if duration seems adequate) and reduced cellular energy production are both hormonally driven.</p>

      <h3>5. Nutritional deficiencies beyond iron</h3>
      <p>Vitamin D, B12, magnesium, and zinc are among the most common deficiencies I see in exhausted women. Each plays a specific role in energy metabolism, mitochondrial function, or nervous system regulation. Deficiency rarely shows up as a single clear symptom — instead, it contributes to a general sense of depletion that is hard to pin down.</p>

      <h3>6. Blood sugar instability</h3>
      <p>Energy that peaks and crashes throughout the day — particularly mid-morning and mid-afternoon — often reflects blood sugar dysregulation rather than tiredness per se. When blood sugar drops, cortisol rises to compensate, and over time this pattern is exhausting in itself. Meal timing, macronutrient balance, and snacking habits all feed directly into this cycle.</p>

      <h3>7. Gut health and nutrient absorption</h3>
      <p>You can eat a perfect diet and still be nutritionally depleted if your gut isn't absorbing properly. Low stomach acid, dysbiosis (imbalance in gut bacteria), and intestinal permeability all impair the absorption of the very nutrients your cells need to produce energy. Fatigue with digestive symptoms is a significant clue.</p>

      <h2>Why "sleep more" is not always the answer</h2>
      <p>Sleep is necessary but not sufficient when fatigue has physiological roots. If your cortisol rhythm is dysregulated, you may sleep eight hours and still wake exhausted. If your thyroid is underperforming, no amount of rest will compensate for insufficient cellular energy production. If your iron is low, your cells are literally not carrying enough oxygen.</p>

      <p>This is not to say sleep doesn't matter — it absolutely does. But when sleep isn't solving the problem, that tells us something important: there is something else going on.</p>

      <h2>What I look for in practice</h2>
      <p>When a client comes to me with chronic fatigue, I take a thorough history — not just of symptoms, but of life patterns, stress, diet, cycle changes, and what has and hasn't helped in the past. I then typically assess thyroid function (full panel), iron studies, vitamin D, B12, and often cortisol rhythm via a saliva or urine test.</p>

      <p>From there, we build a targeted plan — not a generic "eat well and sleep more" prescription, but something that addresses the specific pattern driving your fatigue. In my experience, most people see meaningful improvement within six to twelve weeks when the root causes are properly identified and addressed.</p>

      <p>Chronic exhaustion is not something you have to accept. It is a signal worth investigating — with the thoroughness it deserves.</p>
