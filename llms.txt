- Nutrition and lifestyle — root-cause nutritional assessment, gut health, energy

## Who does Anne work with?
Anne works primarily with women navigating perimenopause and couples who want to conceive. She also supports men with hormonal and gut health issues. Her ideal clients are people who are ready to do the work — those who have tried conventional approaches and are looking for a more thorough, root-cause investigation.

## What makes Anne's approach distinctive?
Anne has developed a proprietary framework that allows her to quickly identify the core issues a client's body is struggling with and shift energy rapidly. She draws on three complementary systems:
1. Traditional Chinese Medicine — energetic diagnostics, herbal medicine, acupuncture theory
2. Functional Medicine — root-cause investigation, lab interpretation, nutritional biochemistry
3. Energy Medicine — whole-person healing, working alongside physical protocols
